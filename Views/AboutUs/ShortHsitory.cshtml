                            The Christian Fellowship Church in Coimbatore is affiliated with the Christian Fellowship Center in Bangalore and holds its gatherings in Kavundam Palayam, Coimbatore. Previously, meetings were conducted in RS Puram, Coimbatore, from 2001 to 2011. During this period, the Church experienced growth, and the Lord appointed leaders whom others could look up to. Subsequently, by the grace of God, the CFC Coimbatore meetings shifted to Krishna Complex, Kavundampalayam.
                            Our emphasis is on the church that the Lord Jesus Christ is building with His disciples, rather than the meeting hall. According to Romans 8:29, our longing is to reflect the image of Christ by becoming more like Him. Our focus is on growing the body of Christ in the locality along with His disciples and making more disciples. As a church, our goal is to preach the undiluted gospel.

                            We believe in Acts 18:10, where our Lord says, 'I have many people in this city.'
                            According to Acts 1:1, where it is written, 'Jesus began to do and teach,' we are also committed to preaching the undiluted gospel.
