                        Coimbatore Christian Fellowship Church (CFC Coimbatore) gathers at 2nd Floor
Krishna Complex, Kalpana Theater Road, Kavundampalayam, Coimbatore
641030, Tamil Nadu, India.
 </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px;">
The Church emphasize on the great commission of our Lord Jesus Christ “ to
make disciples, teaching to observe all that He commanded” ( Matthew 28:19-
20) thus He can build His church in the locality against which the gates of hades
cannot prevail (Matthew 16:18) . To this end we stress on personal holiness
and family relationship especially between husbands and wives, because Satan
primarily tries to destroy Christian homes.
 </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px;">
CFC Coimbatore is affiliated to Christian Fellowship Church, Bangalore and enjoys
fellowship with likeminded churches in India and elsewhere in the world. Cfc
Coimbatore seek spiritual guidance from Bro. Zac Poonen to whom the
building of the New covenant church was revealed in this generation. His
sermons and messages on the subject are available on Cfc Bangalore’s web site
link given below.
 </p>
                    <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px;">
CFC Coimbatore is lead by the plurality of elders (Titus 1:5) who support
themselves for their material needs following the examples of Jesus Christ our
Lord and apostle Paul (Acts 20:33) who worked by their own hands to meet
their earthly needs.
 </p>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px;">
	
 According to Romans 8:29, our longing is to reflect the image of Christ by becoming more like Him. Our focus is on growing the body of Christ in the locality along with his disciples and making more disciples. We believe in Acts 18:10, where our Lord says, 'I have many people in this city'. As a church, our goal is to preach the undiluted gospel.
 </p>
   
     <p style="font-size:19px; line-height: 30px;">

                    <p style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 27px;">
All believers who have a desire to become disciples of Jesus Christ and be part
of the Church that Jesus build are welcomed.
We meet at the above address on every Sunday at 10.00 AM and Wednesday at
7.30 PM
