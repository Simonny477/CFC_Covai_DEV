                            The Christian Fellowship Church in Chennai is associated with the Christian Fellowship Center, Bangalore. It gathers in two places. One is in Tambaram, and the other is at Thirumullaivoyal. Even though the location of the meetings changed, the Church began holding its meetings in Annanagar in the year 2001. During these years, the Church expanded, and the Lord appointed leaders to whom others may look up. In addition to Annanagar, the Church began meeting in Choolaimedu and Tambaram in 2010 for the convenience of its members. Later by the grace of God, an own building was built in Thirumullaivoyal in 2015, and the Choolaimedu and Annanagar meetings convened there.

                            Our importance is on the church which the Lord Jesus Christ is building with his disciples, rather than the meeting hall. According to Romans 8:29, Our longing is to reflect the image of Christ by becoming more like him. The focus is on growing the body of Christ in the locality along with his disciples and making disciples. As a church our goal is to be the lamp on the lamp stand giving light to all who come into the house and not to be placed under a peck measure, which can make the church a market place and a den of thieves. Our desire is that we will please Him so much that He will look at us and say, "Do not be afraid, little flock, for your Father has chosen gladly to give you the Kingdom". Amen.
