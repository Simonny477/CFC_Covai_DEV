                            A genuine work of God may use money, but it is never dependent on money. It is dependent only on the power of the Holy Spirit. Where any work is dependent on money, it is not a genuine work of God. Jesus’ ministry was dependent only on the Holy Spirit. He did accept gifts of money from His followers for His work (Luke 8:2-3). But He never asked anyone at any time for money and He never made His financial needs known to anyone but His Father. This is the way that any ministry that honors God will work even today. Jesus was the first physical “Body of Christ” on earth. Today we in the church are called the spiritual “Body of Christ”. And so we seek to follow the example that Jesus Himself set for us in the matter of finances, during His earthly life.

                            We do not ask anyone for money for our needs, and we do not send out any “prayer letters” hinting about our needs either. We do not take offerings by passing around a bag/plate in our church meetings. We only place a freewill “offering box” in our church auditorium for those who wish to give — cheerfully (II Corinthians 9:7); faithfully (I Corinthians 16:2); secretly (Matthew 6:3-4); and in reconciliation with each other (Matthew 5:23-24).

                            All money that is received as freewill offerings or as voluntary contributions, goes directly to the work of spreading the gospel through conferences, literature and media. We offer registration and food freely to all who attend our general conferences. Our elders support themselves with earthly jobs (like the apostle Paul did), and none of them is supported financially by the church. Our books, articles, and audio and video messages on the internet are also available for anyone in the world to read/hear/view freely. We have received everything freely from the Lord and we give it all out to others freely.

                            All of this ministry certainly requires money, and we are not “financed” by any rich human being. We seek the kingdom of God first, and God supplies ALL our needs always. We seek to follow the example of Jesus Himself — the first “Body of Christ” on earth. So, when people ask us whether they can give to support this ministry, we ask them to go through this Biblical checklist first:

                        <ul style="padding-left:30px;">
                            <li style="list-style:decimal; line-height:30px; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0 15px 0;">Are you a born-again child of God? It is a great honor and privilege to support the work of God on earth; but that privilege is given only to His born-again children (3 John 7).</li>
                            <li style="list-style: decimal; line-height: 30px; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0 15px 0;">Do you have enough money for your family’s needs? Are you sure that your giving will not put your family under any financial strain? You must take care of your family’s needs first (See Mark 7:9-13 and 1 Tim.5:8). Our Father in heaven is very rich and He (like any rich earthly father) does not want any of His children to starve or suffer in any way, just because they gave Him money for His work.</li>
                            <li style="list-style: decimal; line-height: 30px; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0 15px 0;">Do you have any large debts to repay? If so, do clear those debts first. God wants His children to live restful lives, free from all debt. We must first give to Caesar what is his, before we can give anything to God, because God does not want us to give Him Caesar’s money, or anyone else’s money (Matt.22:21; Rom.13:8). (Note: A house-loan is not a “debt” (in the meaning in these verses), because the house is an asset that you posses that is equal in value to the loan taken. For the same reason, a vehicle-loan is also not a debt – provided the vehicle is insured for the value of the loan taken).</li>
                            <li style="list-style: decimal; line-height: 30px; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0 15px 0;">Do you have a clear conscience? Have you done your best to be reconciled with those whom you have hurt in any way? God will not accept any offering from anyone who has hurt someone and still not apologised to that person (Matt.5:23, 24)</li>
                            <li style="list-style: decimal; line-height: 30px; font-size: 16px; margin: 0px 0 15px 0;">Are you giving freely and cheerfully – and not under pressure from any man or even from your own conscience? God loves cheerful givers, not reluctant givers. He does not want gifts from those who give under pressure, or who give in order to fulfill some obligation, or who give merely to ease their conscience, or who give in order to get some reward from Him in return (2 Cor.9:7).</li>
                        </ul>

                            While you go through this checklist, do bear with us. In terms of money, we aim to imitate our Lord Jesus and his teachings. If, after considering the above, you still feel inspired to support this ministry, please contact us.
